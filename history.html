                    The greatest of all the Rings of Power and the most powerful
                    artifact in all of Middle-Earth, the <strong>One Ring</strong>
                    was created by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Orodruin
                    (Mount Doom) during the Second Age. His intent was to
                    concentrate and enlarge his own power, and in time gain
                    overlordship of all of Middle-Earth. Sauron also wanted
                    control over the other 19 Rings of Power, which had been
                    made by Celebrimbor and his people with Sauron's assistance.

                <p>
                    To do this, he concentrated within the One a great part of his own
                    fëa ("soul" or "spirit") by cutting through his hand that was
                    holding the gold, and letting his evil bind with the molten gold.
                    In a sense, the Ring became an extension of Sauron himself, and his
                    power became bound to it.

                    It was also known as the <strong>Ruling Ring</strong>,
                    the <strong>Master Ring</strong>, the <strong>Doom of
                    Man</strong>, the <strong>One Ring</strong>, the
                    <strong>Ring of Power</strong>, and <strong>Isildur's Bane</strong>.
                    The Andvarinaut in the Völsungasaga is considered to be one of the
                    inspirations; though Tolkien himself credited many other myths
                    that revolve around the separation of a part of oneself to grant
                    immortality.

                <p>
                    After its original forging (about SA 1600), Sauron wielded the
                    Ring and battled the resisting Elves, creating the infamous
                    War of the Elves and Sauron. At first the War went well for
                    Sauron, as Eregion was destroyed along with Celebrimbor, the
                    maker of the Elven Rings of Power. But later (about SA 1700)
                    Tar-Minastir of Numenor led a great army to Middle-earth and,
                    together with Gil-galad, destroyed Sauron's army, forcing Sauron
                    to return to Mordor to regroup.
                </p>

                <p class="ides">The One Ring after it was forged</p>
                <p>
                    In SA 3261 Ar-Pharazôn, the last and most powerful of the Kings
                    of Númenor, landed at Umbar at the head of a gigantic army to do
                    battle with Sauron, in contention of Sauron's self-proclaimed
                    title as Overlord of Middle-Earth. The sheer size and might of
                    the Númenórean army was enough to cause Sauron's forces to flee.
                    Sauron surrendered to Ar-Pharazôn and was taken back to Númenor
                    as a prisoner. Tolkien, in a letter written in 1958 (#211),
                    wrote that the surrender was both "voluntary and cunning" so he
                    could gain access to Númenor. Despite 1,500 years of war with
                    Sauron, the Elves had not revealed to the Númenóreans the
                    existence of the One Ring or any of the Rings of Power; thus,
                    Ar-Pharazôn was unaware of it. Sauron was able to use the
                    Númenóreans' fear of death as a way to turn them against the
                    Valar, and toward worship of Melkor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although Sauron's body was destroyed in the Fall of Númenor,
                    his spirit was able to bear the Ring back to Middle-earth and
                    he wielded it in his renewed war against the Last Alliance of
                    Elves and Men between SA 3429 and 3441. Tolkien wrote, "I do
                    not think one need boggle at this spirit carrying off the One
                    Ring, upon which his power of dominating minds now largely
                    depended" (letter #211).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Ring was cut from Sauron's hand by Isildur at the end of
                    the Siege Of Barad-Dur in SA 3441, and he in turn lost it in
                    the River Anduin (at the Gladden Fields) just before he was
                    killed in an orc ambush (TA 2). Since it indirectly caused
                    Isildur's death by slipping from his finger, revealing him to
                    the Orcs, it was known in Gondorian lore as Isildur's Bane.

                <p>
                    The Ring remained hidden in the riverbed for almost two and a
                    half millennia until a Stoor hobbit named Déagol discovered it
                    while on a fishing trip. His friend and cousin Sméagol stole
                    the Ring and murdered Déagol. Sméagol was changed by the
                    Ring’s influence over several centuries into the creature known
                    as Gollum. The Ring, which Sauron had endowed with a will of its
                    own, manipulated Gollum into settling in the Misty Mountains near
                    Mirkwood, where Sauron was beginning to regain strength at Dol
                    Guldur. There he and it remained for nearly five hundred years,
                    until the Ring abandoned him and fell off his finger as he was
                    returning from killing a goblin.

                <h3 id="third"><em>The Hobbit</em></h3>
                <p>
                    As is told in The Hobbit, Bilbo found the Ring while he was lost
                    in the caverns of the Misty Mountains, near Gollum's lair. When
                    The Hobbit was written, Tolkien had not yet conceived the Ring's
                    sinister back-story. Thus, in the first edition of The Hobbit,
                    Gollum surrenders the Ring to Bilbo as a reward for winning the
                    Riddle Game. However, as Tolkien was conceiving the nature of
                    the Ring, he realized that the Ring's grip on Gollum would never
                    permit him to give it up willingly. Therefore, Tolkien revised
                    this chapter in the second edition of The Hobbit: after losing
                    the Riddle Game to Bilbo, Gollum went to get his "Precious"
                    (as he always called it) so he could kill and eat him, but flew
                    into a rage when he found it missing. Deducing that Bilbo had it
                    from his last question— "What have I got in my pocket?"— Gollum
                    chased him through the caves, not knowing that Bilbo had discovered
                    the Ring's powers of invisibility and was following him to the
                    cave's exit. Bilbo escaped Gollum and the goblins that inhabited
                    the Misty Mountains by remaining invisible, but then intentionally
                    left the Ring out of the story he told to the Dwarves he was
                    traveling with. In fact, the version of the events that Bilbo told
                    was the version of the first edition of The Hobbit. Gandalf, who
                    was also travelling with the Dwarves, later forced the real story
                    out of Bilbo, and was immediately suspicious of the Ring's powers.

                <p>
                    Gollum, meanwhile, eventually left the Misty Mountains to track
                    down and reclaim the Ring. He wandered for decades, and was
                    captured when he went to Mordor. Here, he was interrogated and
                    revealed the existence of Bilbo and the Shire.

                <p>
                    In TA 3001, following Gandalf's counsel, Bilbo gave the Ring to
                    his nephew and adopted heir Frodo. This first willing transfer of
                    the Ring in its history sparked the chain of events which eventually
                    led to its unmaking. It is one example of the frequent interplay
                    between apparent chance and destiny, a ubiquitous theme in The
                    Lord of the Rings.

                <p>
                    By this time Sauron had begun to regain his power, and the Dark
                    Tower in Mordor had been rebuilt. In order to prevent Sauron from
                    regaining his Ring, Frodo and eight other companions set out from
                    Rivendell for Mordor in an attempt to destroy it in the fires of
                    Mount Doom. During the quest, Frodo gradually became more and
                    more susceptible to the Ring's power, and it became a heavy
                    burden on him. When he and Sam discovered that Gollum was on their
                    trail and "tamed" him into guiding them to Mordor, he began to feel
                    a strange bond with the wretched, treacherous creature. Gollum gave
                    in to the Ring's temptation, however, and betrayed them to the giant
                    spider Shelob. Believing Frodo to be dead, Sam bore the Ring himself
                    for a short time and experienced the temptation it induced, wearing
                    it briefly twice, although he never succumbed to its seduction.

                    In total, the <strong>One Ring</strong> existed for c. 4867 years
                    and was held by nine people, five of which were Hobbits. Sauron
                    was by far the one to carry it for the most time (c. 1850 years),
                    followed by Gollum (478 years), Bilbo (60 years), Frodo (17 years)
                    and Isildur (2 years).Boromir had the ring only for a few seconds
                    but was corupted .Tom Bombadil also wore the ring on 26 September
                    3018 but was apparently unaffected by it. Of those who held the
                    ring, only Samwise Gamgee, Bilbo Baggins and  Tom Bombadil (who
                    was not affected by the ring in any way) gave it up willingly.
