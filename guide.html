                    Unfortunately, due to the ability
                    to turn the wearer into invisible, the Ring cannot be
                    used as a jewelry. But it might be:

                        don't necessarily have to wear it).

                <p>
                    We advised you to use it only on very special
                    occasions. Also, please ensure that you've read
                    the following descriptions, especially the
                    <a href="#third" style="text-decoration:underline">
                    Side Effects</a>, very carefully before using it.
                </p>
                <h3 id="second">How Does It Work?</h3>
                <p>
                    When a typical person put on the ring, he would be partly
                    "shifted" out of the physical realm into the spiritual realm,
                    walking its threshold. A side effect (but usually the first
                    effect noticed) of this was that it made the wearer invisible
                    to physical beings like living men, but highly visible to
                    spiritual beings like Ringwraiths. This "shadow world" was
                    the world the Wraiths were forced to live in but it was also
                    a world in which the Calaquendi (Elves of Light) held great
                    power. It is likely that a person trying to hide from such
                    Elves (few still dwelt in Middle-earth in the Third Age)
                    using the ring would be easily seen.
                </p>

                <p class="top"><a href="#header">Back to top</a></p>
                <h3 id="third">Side Effects</h3>
                <p>
                    For mortals, the ring had several side effects, most of them
                    negative. Like the Nine rings of Men without making the owner
                    an apparition, it would extend lifespan indefinitely, but the
                    person’s soul would "feel all thin, sort of stretched ...
                    like butter that has been scraped over too much bread"
                    (as Bilbo Baggins put it). One possible positive effect was
                    that the Ring may have granted the wearer some understanding
                    of the speech of evil creatures. While wearing the Ring,
                    Bilbo was able to understand the giant spiders of Mirkwood,
                    and Samwise Gamgee was able to understand the Black Speech
                    being used by the Orcs of Mordor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gandalf held that if the Ring was worn too frequently, the
                    wearer would become wraith-like over time; entirely subsumed
                    into the spirit world. This would depend largely on that
                    person's race and inner nature. Once the Ring was out of
                    their possession, the mortal being would begin to age again.
                    If, however, they merely kept it without using it, they were
                    less under its power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because the ring was created by Sauron it became evil in
                    itself. The ring caused those who possessed it to become
                    obsessed with it, so much so that they might kill anyone
                    who showed too much interest in it or attempted to touch
                    the Ring. With an evil will of its own, the Ring would
                    make attempts to return to its Master. It could "call out"
                    subliminally to other people, in an attempt to get them to
                    pick it up or possibly kill the current owner. It was also
                    capable of slipping unnoticed from the owner's finger, leaving
                    him vulnerable to attack or to gain a new owner that would
                    help get the Ring back to Sauron. Frodo Baggins was warned
                    by Bilbo that the Ring tended to "slip away" at odd times,
                    and compensated for this by wearing it on a chain around
                    his neck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of Sméagol/Gollum, it didn't make him evil or
                    corrupt so much as ugly and obsessive with the ring. Even
                    the Elf-Queen Galadriel was able to postulate the unpleasant
                    physical effect the Ring would have on her (beautiful, but in
                    a terrible way) in the long-term.
                </p>

                <p class="ides">Sméagol (Gollum) after nearly 500 years keeping the One Ring</p>
                <p>
                    Distant from Mordor, the Ring was hampered, unless its Master
                    or other beings of power (such as Ringwraiths near the Inn
                    at Bree) were calling to it, when it would try to respond. But
                    in Mordor it grew so powerful that when Frodo stood on Mount
                    Doom, Sam had a flash of sight in which not only was the Ring
                    seen through Frodo's garments, but spoke of itself to Smeagol:
                </p>
                <p class="quote">
                    "Begone, and trouble me no more! If you touch me ever again,
                    you shall yourself be cast into the Fire of Doom."
                </p>
                <p>
                     Besides the partial, if not complete, loss of sanity over time,
                     there were also physical consequences of carrying the ring.
                     The skin becoming pale and thin, with the veins clearly visible,
                     darkened eyes, teeth and nails, and to most extreme cases, such
                     as Gollum, loss of hair and tissue, leaving the body nearly
                     corpse-like with heavy breathing and rash voice. Although these
                     effects were seen in two hobbits (evident in Gollum and slight
                     in Frodo), the effects are unknown in other races, as none have
                     held the ring long enough for them to become apparent.

                <h3 id="fourth">Fate of The Ring-bearers</h3>
                <p>
                    Of the several bearers of the One Ring, three were still alive
                    following the One Ring's destruction: Bilbo Baggins, Frodo
                    Baggins, and Samwise Gamgee (Although it becomes five when you
                    count Tom Bombadil and Gandalf. Sauron can be considered as
                    well, since he did not truly die according to Gandalf). Bilbo,
                    having borne the Ring longest of the three, had reached a very
                    advanced age for a Hobbit. Frodo suffered both physical and
                    psychological scars from his strenuous quest to destroy the
                    Ring. Samwise, having only briefly kept the Ring was affected
                    the least and appeared to carry on a normal life following the
                    Ring's destruction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In consideration of the trials the Ring-bearers had endured,
                    special dispensation was granted them by the Valar to travel
                    to Tol Eressea, the Elvenhome; though not the Undying Lands
                    themselves, where it was hoped they could find rest and healing.
                    At the close of The Return of the King, Bilbo and Frodo embark
                    for the voyage to the West along with Galadriel, Elrond, and
                    many of their folk, as well as Gandalf. Near the end of his
                    life, Samwise is also said to have sailed to Eressea. Tolkien
                    in one of his letters described the process as a period of
                    extended life and healing, after which, their spiritual scars
                    cured, they would die in peace. No mortal can set foot in the
                    Undying Lands.
